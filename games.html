      <h2>Elden Ring</h2>
<p>I love Elden Ring because it rewards the player who is curious and patient. There isn't much hand-holding and the only way to learn is to explore its vast map. Every area has its own mood, backstory, atmosphere, and brings its own version of curiousity in the player.</p>

<p>Now, in my opinion, the best part about the game, the skill tree and weapons. You customize the character to be your own, either a sword weilding ronin or a caveman who weilds a giant club. The game is unique every single time you play it.</p>

      <h2>Overwatch / Overwatch 2</h2>
      <p>It was either this or Minecraft. I had to put this because Overwatch has been much more consistent in my life. I absolutely hate this game, love it, and angry at it every time I play it. I have been plying it since 2016, with breaks, and am in a toxic relationship with it</p>
      <p>I think it is the competitive aspect of the game coupled with how the heros are designed. (Currently a Sigma main)</p>
